# Creative-Brief-Generator
A simple .html based creative brief generator that allows the user to generate briefs that include a real brand, pain points, insights and target audiences.


The logic used bases all of the brief elements off of the brand. Previously, everything was randomly chosen which posed problems as "tech-savvy shoppers" wouldn't be a target audience for Crate & Barrel.

In addition, users have the feature to download a simple .PDF download of the brief if they land on one that they will run with.
